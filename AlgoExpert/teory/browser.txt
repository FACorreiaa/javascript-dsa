WHAT DO BROWSERS DO WITH OUT HTML

Critical Rendering Path
1. Parse HTML into DOM tree (request any resources found)
2. Parse CSS into CSS Object Modal (CSSOM) tree
3. Combine DOM and CSSOM into render tree
4. Layout (width, height, location)
5. Paint

Dynamic Changes
- color changes = repaint node
- position changes = reflow + repaint node/siblings
- major changes = reflow + repaint document


Preload scanner
- Request high priority resources (scripts, stylesheets, fonts) (works during parsing, doesnt wait for parser to find links)

KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS:
- First Contentful Paint
- First Meaningful Paint
- Time to Interactive

Optimizing for Critical Rendering Path
- Use defer/async scripts
- Minimize DOM size
- Reduce file sizes (compression/minifications)
- Lazy loading - dont request everything at once
- Hardware accelerated animations:
  - Add transform: translate3D(0,0,0)
  - Due to composition, animation handled by GPUU
